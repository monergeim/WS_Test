## placeOrder

The placeOrder API lets you place a new order into exchange. 

If you send a valid order, you should receive a response with "Pending" status, this means that order was validated and accepted. The response contains the exchange orderId which should be stored and used for later status changes, notified via the orderBookDepth stream. 

Non-valid order will be responded with the error message. 
In case of timeout TBD
